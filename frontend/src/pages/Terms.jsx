      <p className="mb-4">Last Updated: September 5, 2025</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Welcome to MyGen! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the MyGen mobile application and services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">By using the MyGen app and services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use the Service.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">2. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">You agree to provide accurate and complete information during the onboarding process and throughout your use of the Service. You are solely responsible for your own health and well-being. The recommendations provided by the MyGen app are for informational purposes only and are not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. MyGen is rooted in the latest scientific understanding of human biology and behavior, and our healthcare professionals ensure all recommendations are grounded in evidence-based medicine and best practices.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">3. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">All content, features, and functionality of the Service, including but not limited to the AI algorithms, the science-backed approach, the "Wellness Diamond framework," text, graphics, logos, icons, images, and their selection and arrangement, are the exclusive property of MyGen and its licensors. These are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, download, store, or transmit any of the material on our Service, except as generally permitted by these Terms. Our co-founders possess deep technical expertise in AI and data science, contributing to the proprietary nature of our technology.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">In no event shall MyGen, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">5. Community Rules (Guild 2.0)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">MyGen fosters a community-driven environment through its "Guild 2.0" model. By participating in the community, you agree to abide by community guidelines designed to promote collective growth and support. You understand that your contributions, including data and insights, may be used to improve MyGen's recommendations for the entire community. Guidelines for earning and using MyGen Points and crypto shares will be provided within the app.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">6. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">Any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of [Arbitration Body, e.g., American Arbitration Association], rather than in court. You agree that any such arbitration shall take place on an individual basis and that class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</p>

      <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
